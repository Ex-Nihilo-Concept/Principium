Ex Nihilo
Latin for: from nothing comes something.
Welcome to the Ex Nihilo community!
Everything, Everywhere is created through this concept.
The Big Bang is the best example of Ex Nihilo. The moment of creation. There was nothing, then.. there was something. Art, Music, Philosophy, Religion, Science  and Life itself are all Ex Nihilo.
Our coin is based on this concept of making something from nothing. Value, Trust, Faith and Mercy are the 4 corner stones upon which Ex Nihilo will become an asset not only as currency unit of worth but also an asset in every day life.
